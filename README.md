The Enhanced Expense Tracker is a Java Swing-based desktop application developed to help users efficiently record, manage, and analyze their daily expenses. The application allows users to enter expense details such as category, amount, and date, view them in a structured table format, and track total spending in real time with budget management support.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, Java GUI development, and event-driven programming.

 Key Features  
- Add and manage expense records with:
  - Category  
  - Amount  
  - Date  
- Display expenses in a JTable  
- Automatic calculation of total expenses  
- Budget tracking functionality  
- Input validation for accurate data entry  
- User-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing  
- Data storage using Java Collections (ArrayList)  

Technologies & Tools  
- Java (Core Java)  
- Java Swing & AWT for GUI  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Java Collections Framework  
- LocalDate & DateTimeFormatter  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans  

Project Objectives  
- To design a desktop-based expense management system  
- To practice Java GUI programming and event handling  
- To apply OOP principles in a real-world application  
- To implement CRUD-style operations for expense records
